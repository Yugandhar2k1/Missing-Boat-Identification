# Missing Boat Identification using GPS and GSM Module

## Overview

The "Missing Boat Identification" project leverages the power of GPS and GSM technology to enhance the safety and security of boats on the water. It provides a reliable means of tracking and identifying boats in distress, helping authorities and boat owners quickly respond to potential emergencies.

## Features

- **Real-time GPS Tracking**: Accurate location tracking of boats using GPS technology.
- **Instant Communication**: Utilizes GSM modules to send boat location data to designated recipients.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Sends automated alerts in case of distress or unusual boat behavior.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Allows boat owners and authorities to monitor boat locations remotely.
- **Improved Safety**: Enhances safety on the water by reducing response times in emergencies.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- GPS module
- GSM module
- Antennas for GPS and GSM
- Power supply
- Optional: Sensors for boat monitoring (e.g., water level, temperature)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Libraries for GPS and GSM modules
- Mobile phone or computer for receiving alerts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Missing-Boat-Identification.git`
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the project file.
3. Install the necessary libraries for the GPS and GSM modules.
4. Customize the code to set up contact information and emergency thresholds.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. Configure the system with relevant contact numbers and alert thresholds.
3. Power on the system and install it on the boat.
4. The system will continuously monitor the boat's GPS location and send alerts when necessary.
5. Receive alerts and boat location data via SMS or through a web interface.
